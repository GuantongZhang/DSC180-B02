Before Week 5, we attempted to analyze recordings using the Triton Software Package on Matlab. This tool provides useful visualization such as spectrograms, from which we can easily recognize birdsongs and airplane noises. We spent most of our time setting up the software and looking at spectrograms of wave files and that's why we don't have any code yet. However, there was a compatibility issue with Mac, and when we were trying to use the computers at the Scripps lab, we weren't able to log in. So our next step is to build a Javascript tool for scalable annotation of audio data, by using the tool in https://github.com/smart-audio/audio_diarization_annotation as a template.
